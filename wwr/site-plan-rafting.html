    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to first and foremost increase revenue, second to showcase the services we have to offer our clients, and third to make client visits easier and more streamlined by giving our clients access to paperwork they need before starting their adventure with us.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target audiences are luxury tourists and business retreats, we strive to provide an invigorating and safe luxury experience to all of our clients.
        We cater to mostly to clients who are between the ages of 21-60, but we will accommodate clients as young as 12 and as old as 70 as long as they are in good health and physically capable of safely enjoying the experience we provide. 
        We do anything from small family groups to large business retreats, our smaller group trips tend to be more laid back as our clients tend to be younger in age. For our business retreat packages we also offer team building activities where new teams can come together and really learn to work as a solid unit and where experienced teams can showcase their skills. 
        We realized a lot of businesses just were not getting what the needed from the retreats they were planning, it was boring and run of the mill, people didn’t want to come! Our experience includes luxurious lodgings and breath-taking scenery, while also accommodating meetings in a more business-like setting for those who can’t afford to stay away from the office for days at a time.
        Our target audience will primarily access our website through a desktop browser.
